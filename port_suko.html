      <h2>Suko Sports Poster</h2>
      <p>In this college project a (fake) brand called Suko was looking for a promotional poster to promote the brand against the likes of Adidas and Nike but must include their new tagline “Power, Strength, Drive”.
        We were required to do market research and create an effective eye-catching poster.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Suko Sports Poster Brief</h2>
      <p>As of the clients requests according to the brief given, the poster had a list of requirements and goals it has to achieve to be satisfactory, these goals are as follows;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Must bring forward Suko core brand values such as empowerment, diversity and inclusivity</li>
        <li>Include the tag line “Willpower, Strength, Drive”</li>
        <li> Help create a healthier mindset and a healthier planet through sport</li>
        <li>Visually striking advert for ages 15-35</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Suko Sports Early Poster Concepts</h2>

      <br>
      <h2>Suko Sports Final Poster Design</h2>
      <p>The final design incorporates all the design elements I set to achieve and invokes a vintage yet timeless feeling within its design. The orange colour scheme was chosen to represent Joy, energy, heat and health which are some of many of the core values behind Suko’s brand identity and this is how I represented that. 
        After Images were added to the text and shoes to emphasise movement and speed and they were coloured inline with the orange representation Shoes were chosen as the core subject as Suko is a sportswear brand and shoes are not only our way of moving forward but a core product in Suko’s catalogue. 
        A dirt and old paper overlays were used to invoke a timeless feeling within the design and warm all the colours in the image to stay inline with the colour scheme.</p>
