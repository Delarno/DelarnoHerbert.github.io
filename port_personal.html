      <h2>Portfolio Website Development</h2>
      <p>Throughout the development of this website there were many prototypes and design changes made before settling on the final design. To start the development process I looked at other portfolio websites and looked at what aspects made them effective in their purpose.</p>

      <h2>Portfolio Website Further Developed Concepts</h2>
      <p>After the sketching phase I proceeded to learn Figma throughout the further concept development stage so I could learn how to use it for the final website. Figma allowed for easy website building with features such as animation and easy layout editing.</p>

      <br>
      <p>After building the final version of the website within Figma, I then learned that I could not fully publish the website outside of Figma's platform and I could not freely link videos within the design for the showcase videos I had developed, as such I decided the best course of action was to self teach myself HTML and CSS in order to create the website with the creative freedom I wanted and all the present features.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Celica Poster</h2>
      <p>With inspiration from 90s Japanese car magazines I wanted to create a poster for my beloved Celica GT, along with this I wanted to further learn programs such as GIMP and INKSCAPE to further my design skillset.</p>
