      <h2>Previous Work Experience</h2>
      <h3>McDonald's Cumbernauld (2019)</h3>
      <p>After leaving High School to pursue further education I got a summer position at McDonald’s Cumbernauld. During my time there I experienced a wide range of customer service and teamwork within the fast paced environment. I completed a basic qualification for workplace health and safety within the kitchen. I held multiple positions along with my team such as speaking to customers directly and providing excellent customer service, keeping the dining area clean and up to tight company standards and beverage making. My co-workers often remarked on my friendly and outgoing nature, politeness and freedom to talk to customers and co-workers alike with respect.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>CeX Cumbernauld (2020 - 2023)</h3>
      <par>During the last few months of my Computer Aided Design course (March 2020) I got a position within CeX Cumbernauld as a Sales assistant shortly before lockdown but as I had not been working there long enough I was let go but due to my great performance starting off in the position I was re-hired after lockdown had ended.
          During my 3 years with the company I have taken multiple responsibilities as a part time sales assistant such as engaging with customers and helping with both company service along with personal technology related questions, as such I have been complimented multiple times with outstanding customer service within reviews and by management. My position requires for me to adapt constantly to a fast pace environment of mainly serving customers and due to my acute interest in technology I was promoted to testing all devices that are booked in to buy, as such I am required to deal and learn a wide variety of different tech and interfaces within a quick and efficient manner.
          Within the team I am often complimented for my politeness and strong ability to work effectively among my co-workers.

          <h3>Supporting Actor with Team Crowd Tracker (2021 - Ongoing)</h3>
      <p>Over the past few years I also done a few jobs with the acting agency Team Crowd Tracker as a background extra. Skills mainly required for the job are confidence and ability to work in a team and speak to directors and I feel over the few jobs I have done for the agency have allowed me to learn these skills further and to build upon them moving forward.</p>
